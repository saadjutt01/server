#### Production

Command to run docker for production:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

It uses specified docker compose file i.e. `docker-compose.prod.yml` present at root.

- `sasjs_server_prod` - image for sasjs server app containing api and web component's build served at route `/`
- `mongodb` - image for mongo database
- `mongo-seed-users` - will be populating user data specified in _./mongo-seed/users/user.json_
- `mongo-seed-clients` - will be populating client data specified in _./mongo-seed/clients/client.json_

### Using node:

#### Development (running api and web seperately):

##### API
