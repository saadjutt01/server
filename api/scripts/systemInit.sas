  @details This program is inserted into every sasjs/server program invocation,
  _before_ any user-provided content.

  A number of useful CORE macros are also compiled below, so that they can be
  available by default for Stored Programs.

  Note that the full CORE library is available to sessions in SASjs Studio.
